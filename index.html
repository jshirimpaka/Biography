                         <div id="detail">
                          <h6>In 1943, Nelson Mandela enrolled at the University of Witwatersrand in Johannesburg to study law.
                          Mandela soon became actively involved in the anti-apartheid movement, joining the
                          African National Congress in 1942. Within the ANC, a small group of young Africans
                          banded together, calling themselves the African National Congress Youth League.

                          Their goal was to transform the ANC into a mass grassroots movement, deriving strength
                          from millions of rural peasants and working people who had no voice under the current regime.
                          Specifically, the group believed that the ANC's old tactics of polite petitioning were ineffective.

                          In 1949, the ANC officially adopted the Youth League's methods of boycott, strike, civil disobedience
                           and non-cooperation, with policy goals of full citizenship, redistribution of land, trade union rights,
                            and free and compulsory education for all children.

                            For 20 years later, Mandela directed peaceful, nonviolent acts of defiance against the South African
                            government and its racist policies, including the 1952 Defiance Campaign and the 1955 Congress of
                            the People. He founded the law firm Mandela and Tambo, partnering with Oliver Tambo, a brilliant student
                            he'd met while attending Fort Hare.

                            In 1956, Mandela and 150 others were arrested and charged with treason for their political advocacy (they were
                            eventually acquitted). Meanwhile, the ANC was being challenged by Africanists, a new breed of black activists
                             who believed that the pacifist method of the ANC was ineffective. Africanists soon broke away to form the Pan-Africanist
                             Congress, which negatively affected the ANC; by 1959, the movement had lost much of its militant support.

                       <div id="detail">
                         <h6>
                           After 27 years in prison, Mandela was set free on February 11,1990.
                           Upon his release from prison, Nelson Mandela immediately urged foreign powers not to reduce their pressure
                           on the South African government for constitutional reform. While he stated that he was committed to working
                           toward peace, he declared that the ANC's armed struggle would continue until the black majority received the
                           right to vote.

                           In 1991, Mandela was elected president of the African National Congress, with lifelong friend and colleague Oliver
                           Tambo serving as national chairperson.



                           From 1994 until June 1999, Mandela worked to bring about the transition from minority rule and apartheid to black majority
                           rule. He used the nation's enthusiasm for sports as a pivot point to promote reconciliation between all South Africans,
                           through bringing the World Rugby turnement to South Africa.

                           By the 1999 general election, Nelson Mandela had retired from active politics. He continued to maintain a busy schedule,
                          however, raising money to build schools and clinics in South Africa's rural heartland through his foundation, and serving
                          as a mediator in Burundi's civil war. He also published a number of books on his life and struggles, among them No Easy Walk
                          to Freedom; Nelson Mandela: The Struggle is my Life; and Nelson Mandela's Favorite African Folktales.
