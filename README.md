# AJAX two review biography website

In this exercise, I create a biography website for one of the most influencial people in recent history, Nelson Mandela.

In addition, I explore  AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript And Xml) in order for not only the pageâ€™s user to be able to complete the review form but also on the page load, the user can see all the submitted reviews as they are displayed on the bottom of the page.
